In order to carry out this task we must examine the Help3.java and identifies ways how we can break
down the code into classes and methods. The code can be broken down as follows:

1. A method which displays the ‘help’ text – helpon( )
2. A method which displays the menu – showmenu( )
3. A method which checks (validates) the entry by the user – isvalid( )
